# Power Automate Projects

some of my projects that utilize Power Automate

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1)Gantt Chart in Microsoft Teams
Utilize Power Automate to  incorporate a Gantt chart into Teams that syncs with Planner.  [more details](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF_RxVV3Jw/BzIfqC2FRy7m6QdI8paWdg/view?utm_content=DAF_RxVV3Jw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)

How it works:

1. Edit your Planner:
Presumably, this step involves making updates or changes to tasks or plans within Microsoft Planner, a task management tool in the Microsoft 365 suite.

2. Go to your Power BI, then click the refresh button:
After making changes in Planner, you navigate to your Power BI dashboard and manually trigger a data refresh by clicking the refresh button. This action prompts Power BI to update the dataset with the latest data.

3. Latest data will reflect on your Dashboard:
Once the refresh process is complete, the Power BI dashboard will display the most up-to-date information from Planner.

Flow:

1. When the button in Power BI is clicked, it will trigger a Power Automate flow:
This indicates that there's an automation set up using Power Automate (formerly known as Microsoft Flow) triggered by a button click within Power BI.

2. The flow will pull the latest data from Planner and then save it to SharePoint:
The Power Automate flow retrieves the updated data from Planner and saves it to a SharePoint document library or list, providing a centralized location for the data.

3. Then the flow will refresh Power BI to get the latest dataset in SharePoint:
After saving the updated data to SharePoint, the Power Automate flow triggers a refresh in the associated Power BI dataset. This ensures that the Power BI dashboard reflects the most recent information pulled from SharePoint.
